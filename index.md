## Reflective Blog 2

I started the class on August 29, 2022, with content on critical thinking and effective written communication. Peter Farrell was the teacher who directly led that session. The lesson has two important and valuable contents: the skill of writing an argument and paraphrasing skill. First, I will cover the skill of writing an argument. After listening to the lecture, I realized that this skill is used to convince and prove to the reader that my point of view is correct. In addition, to write a good and reputable argument, we need to have three main components: an example, evidence, and supporting the idea. In particular, the citation is necessary for an argument because it shows the reader that my views are based on precise data and research. 
Next, paraphrasing is a critical skill in the essay writing process. Because it helps me avoid plagiarism and shows that I have understood the knowledge and researched my way. Moreover, this skill also helps me to improve my vocabulary. In particular, the teacher introduced me to the "chunking" method when performing paraphrasing skills. The method will divide the passage into parts to make it easier to practice paraphrasing skills and ensure that requirements such as changing structure and vocabulary but keeping the original meaning.
